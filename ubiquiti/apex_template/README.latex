The APEX PDFLatex document style file
=====================================

This style file is made for "pdflatex". It will not work with normal Latex.
Figures must be included using PDF format. A sample document is provided to
show the usage of the style file elements.

Please also download the APEX-logo.pdf and draft.pdf files.

For MS Word users there is also an APEX Word Document Template available.
Please check the BSCW server.
