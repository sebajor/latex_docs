\section{Ideal balanced mixer}

In the ideal world $|S_{ij}| = 1$, $\theta_{i,j}=0$ and $\alpha = \beta$. In this configuration we have that the equation \ref{eq:d1_noise} is the inverse of the equation \ref{eq:d2_noise} and the equation \ref{eq:d1_signal} is equal to \ref{eq:d2_signal}.

In this case the combiner doubles the downconverted RF signal and the removes the noise coming from the LO.
