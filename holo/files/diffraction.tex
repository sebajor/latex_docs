\section{Diffraction substraction}

To account the diffraction produced by the secondary a model in the GRASP software was made using the APEX telescope parameters.
The result was transformed to the surface error and scaled to match a grid of 256x256 pixels that is the common pixel size used in APEX holography pipelines. If a map of different pixel size is used a 2D interpolation is made to match the map size.

The figure \ref{fig:grasp_diffraction} shows the GRASP diffraction model, this model is substracted from the large scale corrected map. The figure \ref{fig:diffraction_corrected} shows the effect of the diffraction model substraction.
